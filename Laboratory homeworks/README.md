 RGB 
===
In this project read the values of the potentiometers and use each value to directly control one of the RGB colors.

## Build with:

* 1 RGB LED
* 3 potentiometers
* 3 resistors 
* wires
* Arduino
* Connector cable
Knock detector

 4 Digit 7-Segment Display & Joistyck
===
This project controlling each digit of the segment with the joystick, individually.
* X-axis: cycle through the digits and chose which one to modify. Light up the
DP led of the current position.
* Light from DP led is on of the current position.
* When you press the button the selected digit is lock. 
* Y-axis is used to modify the value of the digit, both up and down.
* When you press the button again, it is unlock the selection and it's able to cycle through the 4 digits
again

## Build with:

* 4 digit 7-segment display
* 1 * joystick
* Resistors
* Wires
* Arduino
* Connector cable

Menu LCD
===

*This project is a demo menu for games.
