#### Pixel was lazy and he did not gather supplies for the winter, so on the last minute he decided to gather supplies to survive. Pixel have a limited time to collect as much supplies as he can and he will encounter obstacles as it advances in level.

# Level 1
### At his first attempt, he does not encounter any obstacles and he can go through walls.

# Level 2
### It's pretty similar to Level 1 but without the ability to go through wall.

# Level 3
### Here he will encounter obstacles - walls in different shapes - that puts him in difficulty in finding food.

# Level 4
### At this point, things get even more worse because more bombs will be placed on the map and he must be very careful at every step he does.

# 2. In level 1 you can go from one side to the other of the matrix (teleportation)
# 3. In level 2 teleportation is no longer valid.
# 4. At level 3 there are walls that you have to bypass to reach the pixels you have to eat, these pixels are blinking.
