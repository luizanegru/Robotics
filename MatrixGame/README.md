#### Pixel was lazy and he did not gather supplies for the winter, so on the last minute he decided to gather supplies to survive. Pixel have a limited time to collect as much supplies as he can and he will encounter obstacles as it advances in level.

# Level 1
### At his first attempt, he does not encounter any obstacles and he can go through walls.

# Level 2
### It's pretty similar to Level 1 but without the ability to go through wall.

# Level 3
### Here he will encounter obstacles - walls in different shapes - that puts him in difficulty in finding food.

# Level 4
### Here, Pixel will face some pretty hard threats because he must be vigilent and avoid the bomb that will be randomly placed on the map.

# Level 5
### At this point, things get even more worse because more bombs will be randomly placed on the map and he must be very careful at every step he does.
